## About Test Pilot

Firefox is built by the the non-profit [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org). We believe in an open, accessible Internet for all,
and Firefox reflects our firm and continuing commitment to these ideals.

Across the world, hundreds of millions of people speaking many languages use Firefox. The size and richness of our global community
is our strength, but it also presents some challenges. How do we experiment with crazy new ideas? How do we develop products in the open 
collaborative way without damaging the core Firefox user experience? How do we test new ideas and get user feedback 
without compromising our [core beliefs in user privacy and choice](https://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto/)?

Test Pilot is our answer to these questions. With Test Pilot, we've made an *opt-in* platform, intended to let Mozilla Designers and Engineers try out new
ideas on a willing audience. We use Test Pilot to play with ideas before we ship them to an audience of millions. Here's how the process works . . .

### The Test Pilot Life cycle

We come up with of ideas about new features for Firefox all the time. At Mozilla, we've too often struggled to decide which features belong in Firefox and which don't.
These decisions aren't just academic: implementing a new feature in Firefox can cost millions of dollars and thousands of hours
of design and engineering time. Shipping a feature that nobody uses can be painful and costly. Conversely, we've occasionally shied away from taking big bets
on new feature ideas because we have never had a good mechanism for iterating and improving over time.

Test Pilot is more than just the web app you're currently looking at. It's a *research, design, and development process* aimed at making feature exploration and development less costly, 
while allowing us to play with more radical ideas for Firefox. The process consists of four parts.

#### *Phase One:* Low Fidelity Validation

In *Phase One*, The Test Pilot Team solicits ideas for new features from across Mozilla (soon we'll be asking our users to contribute as well).

When we hear a promising idea, we conduct a bunch of research to define both the problem we want to solve, and 
the possible shapes that our experimental solutions might take. We look at existing strategies in the market for solving similar problems, and we spend a ton of time sketching and
tinkering with simple prototypes. Sometimes these prototypes are doodles on paper, sometimes we mock things up in PhotoShop, and sometimes we explore in code. The name
of the game in this phase is to learn quickly and cheaply. If an idea doesn't make it out of *Phase One*, that's just fine. We've saved ourselves a lot of headache down the road
and learned something to boot. If an experiment graduates to *Phase Two*, we start to get a little more serious. 

#### *Phase Two:* Defining an Experiment for Test Pilot

In *Phase Two*, we determine the shape of the experiment that we want to ship in Test Pilot. We begin this process by reviewing what we've learned in *Phase One*,
and defining a set of requirements that describe the features and functions an experiment needs to ship. We use these requirements to mock up a high fidelity
prototype and conduct user testing to evaluate the user experience and interface of the prototype.

After we've tested our prototype, requirements are adjusted to match our findings and we then build the actual experiment that we plan to ship to our users.
Before we ship, we do another round of user testing to make sure everything works. We have a bunch of meetings with lawyers, and marketers, and data scientists. Then we launch
the experiment into active testing on Test Pilot!

#### *Phase Three:* Active Testing in Test Pilot

This is where *you* get to try things out. While experiments are in *Phase Three*, we monitor their performance and listen to user feedback. As experiments progress, we fix problems,
make iterative changes and improvements, and gain insights into how (or whether) people like what we're building. During this phase we also spend a lot of time 
planning next steps. Once we begin to understand how an experiment performs during this phase, we look to the future and ask what happens next.

#### *Phase Four:* Graduation!

Once are satisfied that we understand how a Test Pilot experiment performs, that experiment is ready to graduate from Test Pilot. Depending on the results of
*Phase Three* we may abandon an experiment altogether, or conduct more testing. While Test Pilot can give us insights into
how to shape and improve user interfaces, it can't tell us much about how the average Firefox user might like an experimental feature. To answer these questions we conduct
randomized opt-in experiments on Firefox users. If everyone loves the experiment, the feature will likely move into Firefox itself. On the other hand, if the reaction is mixed, the experiment will
most likely ship as a regular add-on. 

For experiments like Tracking Protection, the goal is not to ship UI in Firefox, but to gain data that improves the browsing experience for all of our users. These experiments graduate
when we're satisfied that we've learned enough to implement changes to Firefox based on what we've learned.

Once we've made final decisions, experiments are removed from Test Pilot. Before removing an experiment from Test Pilot, we will message our users to let them know to expect a change. We will also provide detailed
reports about what we've learned and what the fate of the experiment will be.

So that's Test Pilot. We're really happy you're here. Please check out our experiments and tell us what you think. If you
have questions or would like to talk more, [you can find us on our forum](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/test-pilot).

**Thanks for flying with us!**
